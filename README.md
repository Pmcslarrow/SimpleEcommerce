# SimpleEcommerce
A simple React App that will have a homepage with some products / add to cart button. The main point of the project will be to better understand the useContext hook in React so that I can handle state management of cart items globally. 

The overall design of the project was not my main focus, but rather had an intense focus on the overall functionality using React Hooks (useState and useContext)
